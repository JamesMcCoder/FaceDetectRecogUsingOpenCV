# FaceDetectRecogUsingOpenCV
Face Detection and Recognition Using OpenCV

Inspiration from the many coders out there sharing their work and passion.

This project is running on a Rasperry Pi 3 (Jessie).

I am just starting the core functionality and not clean proper code for now.

I will enhance it to use a USB Camera, but first phase is to have it identify people in existing picture set.
The pictures are just a mass download from Google Pictures.

I currently manually enter 1 picture to test the accuracy.  By no means is that what I want for the end goal.

The conversion from ID to Person Name is just a quick hack but will refactor that out.


Be sure to change the folder locations for your:
-trainning.py - dataSet YML file store location
-trainning.py - YML file name
-facerecognition.py - filename and locaiton
-facerecognition.py - faceCascade filename and location
-facerecognition.py - test file name
-facerecognition.py - test file write filename and location
